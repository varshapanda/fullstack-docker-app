# Fullstack Docker Application

This is a fullstack web application built using React for the frontend, Express for the backend, and PostgreSQL as the database. The project will be containerized using Docker in the upcoming stages.

## Setup I - Initial Project Structure

This phase focuses on setting up the basic structure of the project before adding Docker and database services.

### Completed in this step:

- Created folders for frontend, backend, and database
- Added empty Dockerfiles for frontend and backend
- Created `.env` file and `docker-compose.yml` (empty)
- Implemented basic Express backend with PostgreSQL connection
- Built a simple React frontend that fetches data from the backend
